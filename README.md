# Project 2 - *Flix App*

**Flix app** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [x] Customize the UI.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Adding Custom Animations
2. Using Cocoa pods to add additional icons for the reload.

## Notes
I messed up the git pulls and push so I lost some of my code near the end of its completion. After redoing the lost portions off the app, I had to swap my current loaner mac for my official work mac since it had arrived at the IT desk. When transfering files between the macs, my app code did not successfully transfer. I got most of it back from my repository, but I had to redo the lost parts again. These accidents make up the bulk of my app dev time. The only optional I could do was changing the background color. I ran out of time before I had working versions of this app code with optionals included.
